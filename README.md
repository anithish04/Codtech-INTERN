INTERN ID: CT04DM449
DOMAIN: DATA SCIENCE
DURATION: 4 WEEKS
TASK DESCRIPTION: 
Task 1: Data Pipeline Development
The first task involves creating an automated pipeline for data preprocessing, transformation, and loading (ETL). 
Interns are required to use Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn. The goal is to streamline raw data into a clean, analysis-ready format. 
This process includes handling missing values, encoding categorical data, normalizing features, and splitting datasets. 
Deliverables include a Python script or Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the full pipeline workflow, emphasizing modularity and reusability.

Task 2: Deep Learning Project
In the second task, interns must implement a deep learning model for either image classification or natural language processing (NLP). 
This task uses popular frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Interns are expected to build, train, and evaluate their models, along with providing clear visualizations such as loss and accuracy graphs. 
This project enhances understanding of neural networks, activation functions, loss optimization, and model validation techniques. The final deliverable is a functional model along with result visualizations.

Task 3: End-to-End Data Science Project
This task challenges interns to complete a full-scale data science projectâ€”from data collection and cleaning to model deployment. 
Using either Flask or FastAPI, interns must create a web application or REST API that serves their machine learning model. 
This introduces important concepts in model deployment, such as building endpoints, integrating front-end and back-end logic, and testing the deployed service. 
The final deliverable is a running application or API accessible via a browser or HTTP requests, showcasing the model in action.

Task 4: Optimization Model
The fourth task introduces operations research and optimization, requiring interns to solve a business problem using techniques such as linear programming. 
Tools like PuLP, a Python library for linear optimization, will be used to set up constraints and objectives, model decision variables, and derive optimal solutions. 
Interns will analyze results and provide business insights based on the model's outcomes. The deliverable is a well-documented Jupyter Notebook outlining the problem, methodology, solution, and interpretations.
